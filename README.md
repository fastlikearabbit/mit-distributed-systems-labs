Lab solutions for MIT 6.5840 Distributed Systems (Spring 2025).

Note to self: After spending 2 weeks having nightmares about Raft and distributed systems in general 
(working 12-15 hours a day isn't a good idea as you're also basically working while sleeping in my case), especially since today (10/22/25) I spent close to 6 hours on a bug only to realize that I need
to fully initialize the server state before initializing the RSM for lab 4, I definitely
need to take a break. Will most likely start lab 5 at the end of next week.
